# Notes

The template and css makes a presentation that has a few tweaks in `slides-style.css`.  `slide-style.css` is adapted from An RStudio workshop on data science [design-ds-classroom](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/design-ds-classroom) by [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel). 

* I have tweaked the title slide css in `slides-style.css` and needed to remove `date:` from the yaml.
* `slides-style.css` has a number of extra customizations such as square for the bullets, some colored boxes, and a wide left column class.
* Instead of page numbers, there is a progress bar across the top.
* You may want to futz with the css for the title at the top of `slides-style.css`
* To add a Table of Contents, I wrote a helper function `render_toc.R` and add `name:` and `text:` to each slide. `name` should have no spaces. `text` is what you want to show for the TOC. If you leave off `text:`, it will use `name`. If you leave off `name`, the slide won't appear int he TOC.
* I am using `https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra` to have the tile navigation.

```{r setup-toc, include=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source('assets/render_toc.R')
```

## Table of Contents

At any time, you can press "O" (capital O) and see tiles of the slides that you can jump between.

```{r toc, echo=FALSE, class="flexcolumn"} 
render_toc("template-extra.Rmd")
```

name: sidenotes
text: Side notes

## Side notes


.pull-left-wide[
1. This has side notes in a 'hand' font.
1. There is black and blue versions.
]
.pull-right-narrow[
.hand-blue[
You can add sidenotes. Here I have wrapped the text in `.hand-blue` to make it smaller and blue.
]

.hand[
You can add black sidenotes.
]
]

name: sidemargins
text: Side margins

## Side margin



.pull-left-wide[
The side margin is not limited to text.

- Figures
- References
- Images

Everything will get scaled to fit.
]
.pull-right-narrow[
.hand-blue[
```{r}
plot(1:10)
```

name: Footnotes


# Footnotes

Because the NMFS footnote is already occupying the footnote space, you need to add some linefeeds to move the footnote upward. 



- some content
- a [link](http://www.google.com)


```{r}
r <- 2 + 2
```

.footnote[It is quite finicky. Add a linefeed and it breaks.<br><br>]



---
name: Boxes

# Boxes

.bluebox[## Blue box
- The ## header will appear at the top in grey
- Or leave it off and add different text or header
]

.orangebox[## Orange box
```{r fig.height=2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(1:100)
```
]

.yellowbox[## Yellow box
A note.
]

---
name: boxside
text: Boxes with side note


# Boxes and side notes

.pull-left-wide[
.orangebox[## Orange box
```{r fig.height=2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(1:100)
```
]
]

.pull-right-narrow[
.hand-blue[
You can add sidenotes. Here I have wrapped the text in `.hand-blue` to make it smaller and blue.
]

.small[`.small` also works but the text is different. You can change this in the css. Note you need a linefeed in the side note code.
]

.small[If you leave off the line-feed, then it will use a span element and won't pick up the right line-height spacing.]]
