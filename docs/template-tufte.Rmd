# Notes

The template and css makes a presentation that is vaguely like a Tufte handout in that it has Tufte font and you can have side notes.

* I have tweaked the title slide css in `slides-style.css` and needed to remove `date:` from the yaml.
* `slides-style.css` has a number of extra customizations such as square for the bullets, some colored boxes, and a wide left column class.
* I couldn't get `self_contained: true` to work for this one so you cannot make a self-contained html file.

## Tufte style

### Changes

.pull-left-wide[
1. The Tufte style is best known for sidenotes $^1$ but also has a number of other features.  
  - Tufte font
  - Specific size ratios for text to headers
  - Different line spacing
1. The Tufte style is specified in the `tufte.css`
]
.pull-right-narrow[
.hand-blue[
You can add sidenotes. Here I have wrapped the text in `.hand-blue` to make it smaller and blue.

$^1$ In order to add a sidenote with number, you'll have to do that manually.
]
]

## You can put anything in the side margin


.pull-left-wide[
The side margin is not limited to text.

- Figures
- References
- Images

Everything will get scaled to fit.
]
.pull-right-narrow[
.hand-blue[
```{r}
plot(1:10)
```

# Footnotes

Because the NMFS footnote is already occupying the footnote space, you need to add some linefeeds to move the footnote upward. 



- some content
- a [link](http://www.google.com)


```{r}
r <- 2 + 2
```

.footnote[It is quite finicky. Add a linefeed and it breaks.<br><br>]

# `slides-style.css` has boxes

.bluebox[## Blue box
- The ## header will appear at the top in grey
- Or leave it off and add different text or header
]

.orangebox[## Orange box
```{r fig.height=2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(1:100)
```
]

.yellowbox[## Yellow box
A note.
]

# Boxes and side notes

.pull-left-wide[
.orangebox[## Orange box
```{r fig.height=2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(1:100)
```
]
]

.pull-right-narrow[
.hand-blue[
You can add sidenotes. Here I have wrapped the text in `.hand-blue` to make it smaller and blue.
]

.small[`.small` also works but the text is not itallic or blue. Note you need a linefeed in the sidenote code.
]

.small[If you leave off the line-feed, then it will use a span element and won't pick up the right line-height spacing.]]
